This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

# Hot Update Demo

This demo integrates a minimal hot update flow and a native module.

## Server

Start the minimal update server (already created in sibling folder):

```sh
cd /Users/dxm/Documents/myFE/rn-hot-update-min/server
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Optional: Diff Patch

Generate a chunk-based patch when you publish a new bundle:

```sh
node /Users/dxm/Documents/myFE/rn-hot-update-min/server/scripts/add-release.js \
  --label ios-v2 \
  --platform ios \
  --appVersionRange ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0" \
  --appVersion "1.0.0" \
  --bundle /Users/dxm/Documents/myFE/rn-hot-update-min/server/bundles/ios-v2/index.bundle \
  --description "iOS v2" \
  --diffAgainstLabel ios-v1 \
  --diffAgainstBundle /Users/dxm/Documents/myFE/rn-hot-update-min/server/bundles/ios-v1/index.bundle
```

## Client

1) Ensure dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage \
  react-native-device-info \
  react-native-fs \
  crypto-js
```

2) iOS pods:

```sh
cd ios && bundle exec pod install
```

3) Run app:

```sh
npm run ios
# or
npm run android
```

> UpdateManager is in `src/UpdateManager.ts`. It calls the server at `http://localhost:3000`.
